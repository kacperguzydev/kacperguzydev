I'm a 20-year-old Data Engineer with 3 years of hands-on experience building real-time data pipelines and analytics dashboards from real-world problems.

My main languages are **Python** and **SQL**, and I work with tools like **Apache Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Databricks,** and **Azure**.  
I've also worked with **AWS** and **GCP** on smaller pipelines and cloud-based integrations.

Currently working on smart meter analytics and Delta Lake KPIs in Databricks Community Edition.
