# Hello, I'm Kacper

I'm a 20-year-old Data Analyst with 3 years of hands-on experience turning raw data into actionable insights through analysis, reporting, and dashboards.  

I specialize in **Python** and **SQL** for data analysis and work with tools like **pandas, numpy, Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to create clear, data-driven stories that help businesses make better decisions.  

Along the way, I’ve also built data pipelines and automated workflows using **Apache Kafka, Spark, Airflow**, and cloud platforms like **Databricks** and **Azure** — giving me a strong foundation in scalable data processing when needed.  

Right now, I'm focused on smart meter analytics, KPI tracking, and real-time dashboards using Databricks Community Edition.  

**My tools include:**  
Python, SQL, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Azure, Docker.
