# Hello, I'm Kacper

I'm a 20-year-old Data Engineer & Data Analyst with 3 years of hands-on experience designing data pipelines, analyzing datasets, and building dashboards that turn raw data into actionable insights.

I specialize in **Python** and **SQL**, and have worked across the entire data workflow — from ingesting and processing data with **Apache Kafka, Spark, and Airflow**, to visualizing KPIs and trends using **Power BI, Streamlit**, and **Tableau**.

I’ve built cloud-based data solutions with **Databricks** and **Azure**, and also completed smaller projects using **AWS** and **GCP**.

Right now, I'm working on smart meter analytics with real-time data pipelines and Delta Lake KPIs in Databricks Community Edition.

**My tools include:**  
Python, SQL, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Azure, Docker, dbt, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit.

Feel free to explore my projects — everything is public.
