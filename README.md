# Hello, my name is Kacper

I'm a 20-year-old Data Engineer & Data Analyst with 3 years of hands-on experience designing data pipelines, building dashboards, and turning raw data into actionable insights from real-world problems.

I specialize in **Python** and **SQL**, and have experience across the full data workflow — from ingesting and transforming data in **Apache Kafka, Spark, Airflow**, to analyzing and visualizing it using **Power BI, Streamlit**, and **Tableau**.

I've worked on cloud-based pipelines and data solutions with **Databricks, Azure**, and smaller integrations on **AWS** and **GCP**.

Currently, I'm building smart meter analytics with real-time pipelines and Delta Lake KPIs in Databricks Community Edition.

**My tools include:**  
Python, SQL, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Azure, Docker, dbt, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit.

Feel free to explore my projects — everything is public.
